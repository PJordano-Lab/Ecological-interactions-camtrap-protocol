This repository contains the details and associated code for the paper: _A Machine Learning Application to Camera-Traps: Robust Species Interactions Datasets for Analysis of Mutualistic Networks_. The ms is now under review, available at bioRxiv, [here](https://doi.org/10.####/2025.03.##.######). 

## Summary
You can use this repository as a guide for processing large numbers of video-file sets generated during camera trap surveys for monitoring animal-plant interactions (i.e., visits of animal frugivores to fruiting plants). We combine a camera trap field protocol (preprocessing) with several tools for time-saving processing (and post processing). 

This workflow aids to manage camera traps in the field, transfer and store data to the lab and post-process large video files batches, reducing effort and time in the database compilation. The method combines a field protocol based on camera trap operation and data standards together with Artificial Intelligence for image recognition and a viewer interface to visualize and tag images. The main objective is to build an accurate and fully annotated dataset for animal-plant interactions records while time effort is minimised. This paper accompanies Villava _et al_. (2024).
